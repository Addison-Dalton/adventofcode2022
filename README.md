# Advent of Code 2022
This repo contains my attempts to the various challenges presented during the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

## How to run
This requires at least Node 16 to run. All the solutions are written in TypeScript, and will have to be compiled prior to running with Node. (Unless you use `ts-node`). As such, steps to run:
```
yarn install
yarn build
node dist/day1
```
(Replace day1 with the day you wish to run)
